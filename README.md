# Student-score-management-program-design
This is the code for the homework that I helped Wang Yiheng（王一赫） complete for a fee. However, after completion, I was insulted and refused payment by the other party. I am sharing the code here because I hope that Mr. Wang Yiheng can become an honest person in the future.


#Java Coursework (20 marks)
Student score management program design
In the following time you will be required to write an educational 
management system in JAVA to your individual ability. This task will count for 
20% of the final grade for this course and a higher code check rate will be 
considered as the task not being completed.
Design requirements:
The system may include Person, Student, Teacher, Course and Score
classes. The properties and functions of the classes may be designed as 
required and reflect the relationships of the classes, such as inheritance, 
association, etc., in order to achieve the functionality of student grade 
management. There are at least 5 students and 1 teacher per course, and each 
student takes at least 3 courses. 
Functional requirements:
Write menu options that allow the user to select the following functional 
requirements:
1) Query information related to a course, such as number of students, teacher's 
name, list of all students' names, etc.;
2) Query the marks of a student for all courses;
3) Query the marks of all students in a course and calculating the average mark 
for that course;
4) Query the ranking of marks in a course
5) Query the percentage of all students in a course in different mark bands: e.g.,
Excellent (90-100), Good (80-89), Medium (70-79), Pass (60-69), Failed
students (0-59);
6) Modify a student's mark in a course through the keyboard;
7) Add or remove students from a course;
8) Log in or out of the system.
You can also implement other functions as required, which will give you extra 
marks depending on the level of difficulty (no more than 20), such as 
implementing menu effects in a GUI, importing or deleting students, teachers, 
courses with one click, etc. It is important that the various types of programs 
are interlinked, more loopholes or BUG are still not allowed.
Submission requirements:
1) Program design document: This includes an analysis of the functional 
requirements of the system, a diagram of the UML classes, whether each 
function of the program is implemented properly, and whether BUG occurred 
during the design process and how they were resolved (or not resolved yet). 
The document is submitted in the form of a WORD document, which can be 
interspersed with code content as appropriate, and requires clear and 
informative typography to ensure that the functional requirements have been 
correctly analyzed and that the specific implementation of each function has 
been successfully presented.
2) Source code: Original code that implements the functions mentioned above, 
with certain comments to be kept between the code.
Marking criteria:
[Excellent: 16-20].
1) The code will achieve the above-mentioned functions perfectly and run 
without bugs. there are additional functions implemented.
2) The code is well designed, well structured, with clear and necessary 
comments.
3) Standardization of programming files and reasonable code structure.
4) Programming documentation meets the requirements and reflects the full 
results of one's work and is beautifully laid out and formatted.
[Good: 10-15].
1) The above functions will be achieved basically, and there are no bugs or a 
small number of acceptable bugs after running.
2) The code is well designed and structured, with a small number of 
comments retained.
3) Standardization of programming documentation and reasonable code 
structure.
4) Programming documentation reflects some of the individual's work.
[Poor: 0-9]
1) The above functions are not fully implemented and bugs appear after 
running.
2) The code design is unreasonable, basically without logic, or is identified as 
plagiarism.
3) The programming documentation is not standardized and the code 
structure is unreasonable.
4) Missing programming documentation, or not reflecting personal work 
product.
